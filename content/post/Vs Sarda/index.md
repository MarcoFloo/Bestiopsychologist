![screen reader text](chess1.jpg "Starting Position")

d4 d5
{style="color: green"}

The game starts with the Queen's Pawn Opening. Both players are occupying the center with our pawns.

Nf3 Bg4
{style="color: green"}

I develop my knight to a natural square, while Black brings out their bishop to attack my knight.

h3 Bxf3
{style="color: green"}

I force Black to capture my knight with their bishop, which loses a tempo for Black since they now have to move their bishop twice in the opening.

exf3 a6
{style="color: green"}

I decide to keep the pawn structure intact by playing exf3 instead of capturing with the pawn. Black continues with a pawn move to prepare for b5.

c4 dxc4
{style="color: green"}

I gain space in the center by advancing my c-pawn which offers a pawn exchange. Black accepts the exchange, which opens up the d-file for me.

Bxa6 gxf3
{style="color: green"}

I sacrifice my bishop to potentially create some attacking chances. Black captures the bishop with their pawn.

Bxb7+ Kxb7
{style="color: green"}

![screen reader text](brilliant3.jpg "Brilliant Move")
I attack Black's king with my bishop, forcing Black to move their king to a better square. This move has several important features that make it brilliant. First, it creates a double attack on Black's king and queen, as the bishop is now threatening to capture the queen on b7, while also opening up a diagonal for my queen to enter the attack. Second, it removes Black's powerful rook from the board, which was controlling the d-file and potentially threatening to infiltrate my position. Third, it creates a pawn on b7 that can become a powerful passed pawn if I can advance it down the board.

Black can capture the bishop with their king, but this would expose the king to a dangerous attack, as my queen and remaining bishop are well-placed to coordinate an assault. Alternatively, Black can capture with their queen, but this would also be risky, as my queen can then swing over to the king side and continue the attack. Ultimately, Black chose to play Kc8, which allowed me to play Qb6 and win the rook on a8, further consolidating my advantage.

Qb5+ Kc8
{style="color: green"}

I attacks Black's king with their queen, forcing Black to move their king to the c8 square.

Overall, this was a very interesting game with both players creating some counter play on both sides of the board. My pawn sacrifice on move 22 was particularly noteworthy, potentially creating some attacking chances on the king-side. This game ended with my win a few moves later.
