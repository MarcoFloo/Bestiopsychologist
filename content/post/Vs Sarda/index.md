The game starts with the Queen's Pawn Opening. Both players are occupying the center with their pawns.

Nf3 Bg4
White develops their knight to a natural square, while Black brings out their bishop to attack White's knight.

h3 Bxf3
White forces Black to capture their knight with the bishop, which loses a tempo for Black since they now have to move their bishop twice in the opening.

exf3 a6
White decides to keep the pawn structure intact by playing exf3 instead of capturing with the pawn. Black continues with a pawn move to prepare for b5.

White gains space in the center by advancing their c-pawn and offers a pawn exchange. Black accepts the exchange, which opens up the d-file for White.

Bxc4 Nc6
White develops their bishop to attack Black's pawn on d5. Black responds with a knight move that also attacks White's pawn on e4.

O-O e6
White castles to safety, and Black develops their bishop to e7 to prepare for castling.

Rc1 Be7
White develops their rook to the semi-open c-file, while Black continues to develop their pieces.

Ba2 O-O-O
White moves their bishop to a safe square, and Black castles queenside, which could be risky since their king is now exposed.

White attacks Black's pawn on a6 and forces Black to move their queen again.

White continues to put pressure on Black's position with the rook on c1, and Black pushes their g-pawn to attack White's knight on f3.

Qa4 Rd6
White attacks Black's pawn on a6 again, and Black moves their rook to d6 to defend the pawn and prepare for the doubling of the rooks on the d-file.

b4 Nxe3
White sacrifices their b-pawn to open up the b-file and put pressure on Black's position. Black captures the pawn with their knight, which is now on an active square.

fxe3 f5
White continues to put pressure on Black's position with the pawn on f3 and the rook on c5, while Black pushes their f-pawn to create counterplay.

Bc4 g4
