**What Are brilliant Moves In Chess?**


_Brilliant_ chess moves are creative, unexpected and effective moves in a chess game that lead to a strong advantage or a quick win. Some examples of brilliant moves include sacrifices, combinations, traps, and tactical blows. The beauty of a chess move lies in its efficiency, unexpectedness, and its ability to showcase a player's understanding of the game and their opponent's weaknesses. There is no one definition of a brilliant move as it is subjective.

Chess.com (the current largest chess platform) uses an algorithm to follow your games that operates at varying levels of depth for calculations depending on how much time it has to "think". A move is "brilliant" if the engine doesn't think the move is best before the move is played, but after it is played the algorithm assess the move at the best possible option in the position. The evaluation of the position then changes significantly in that player's favor as a result.

Here I will post brilliant moves from my games that I find interesting.
