title: Cluster Analysis
summary: Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

Cluster Analysis in Human Resources: Explained

Cluster analysis is a statistical method that helps group data points based on their similarities. In the field of Human Resources, this technique can be used to group employees based on their skills, behaviors, and other traits. This can be valuable in making better informed decisions about employee development, team formation, and job placement.

How Does Cluster Analysis Work?

Cluster analysis works by dividing data points into groups based on their similarities. The algorithm begins by defining a measure of similarity between data points. This can be done using various methods, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine similarity. Once the similarity measure is defined, the algorithm can start dividing the data points into clusters. There are several methods to do this, including k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering.

Applications in Human Resources

There are several ways in which cluster analysis can be used in Human Resources:

1.Employee Segmentation: Cluster analysis can be used to segment employees based on their skills, behaviors, and other traits. This can be valuable in determining which employees are a good fit for specific projects or teams.


2.Job Placement: By grouping employees based on their skills and behaviors, cluster analysis can help HR managers make better informed decisions about job placement. This can help improve job satisfaction and employee performance.


3.Team Formation: Cluster analysis can be used to identify employees who have similar skills and behaviors. This information can be valuable in forming teams that have complementary skills and can work well together.


4.Employee Development: Cluster analysis can be used to identify areas where employees may need further development. For example, if a group of employees are found to have similar skills and behaviors, HR managers may want to provide additional training or resources to help them grow in their careers.

**Class Project**

For an example given in class A K-means cluster analysis was performed to compare three species of iris flowers (senosa, versicolor, virginica) that were measured in four categories (sepal length/width and pedal length/width) with generated clusters. 


After using the elbow method, the silhouette method, and the gap statistic method, the graphs showed that the optimal number of clusters was two-four clusters. However, there are only three different species of iris flower. The estimated average silhouette width for the three clusters was 0.55, which indicated that having three clusters is acceptable. 

The cluster plot also indicated that three clusters are sufficiently separate, and the overlapping area is small. A table showing the species along with their cluster assignments was created. The first cluster perfectly matched the first species. The second cluster is also acceptable. The third cluster is acceptable, but not as accurate as the first two clusters since it includes cases for the other two species. Overall, the cluster analysis suggests that three clusters is appropriate for the three species data.


Conclusion

Cluster analysis is a valuable tool for Human Resources professionals looking to make informed decisions about employee development, team formation, and job placement. By grouping employees based on their similarities, HR managers can gain valuable insights into their employees and use this information to improve their operations. With the right tools and techniques, cluster analysis can be a powerful tool for improving employee performance and satisfaction
